## High-level Genomic Sequencing Expenditure
---

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
In order to have a <b>high-level and initial estimation of genomic sequencing expenditure</b>, based on current (2022) and future (2050) cancer incidence, I have decided to explore a very basic scenario. Europe and North America are aggregated here as regions where <b>some adoption of sequencing is already underway</b>.
</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
This approach assumes one sample per case, and explores a range of <b>uptake levels</b>, defined here as the proportion of newly diagnosed cancer cases that would undergo genomic sequencing. Different cost scenarios are tested, ranging from €200 to €1000 per sample. The analysis reflects the use of <b>targeted panel sequencing</b>, which is currently the most common approach in oncology for identifying actionable mutations.
