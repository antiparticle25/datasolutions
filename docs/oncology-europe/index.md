## Cancer Incidence & Projection

---

Cancer incidence is rising globally, with the number of new cases projected to nearly double by 2050 compared to 2025 ([WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer](https://www.iarc.who.int/)). In this context, I have explored the financial landscape of genomic sequencing in oncology, with a particular emphasis on Europe. 

While sequencing may not always be pivotal for initial diagnosis, it plays a critical role in guiding therapeutic decision-making and treatment stratification. I have a strong personal interest in colorectal and lung cancer subtypes, due to their incidence on the maternal side of my family [originating from Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_India), which forced me to a prolonged career break. Such experience, however, has given me a detailed understanding of the key biomarkers and current therapeutic lines for these cancers.
